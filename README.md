# Python Interview Question

## Prerequisites

These should be installed / created before starting the question.

This task will be done in Python. You do not need to be fully fluent with enterprise production Python, but you should be comfortable with general syntax and patterns e.g. try/except.

It will be helpful to have your IDE of choice set up with syntax highlighting for Python.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed. To check run `python --version`.
2. Install [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). You should be able to get it with `pip install virtualenv`
3. Install + configure git locally: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
4. Set up the development environment for flask.
    - `git clone https://github.com/pallets/flask.git`
    - `cd flask`
    - Create a virtualenv with `virtualenv env`.
    - Activate the virtualenv with `source env/bin/activate`.
    - Install the flask development dependencies `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
    - Install pytest with `pip install pytest`.
    - Confirm that you can run the test suite. You can do this by running `py.test` in your terminal.
    - You can exit the virtualenv by running the command `deactivate`.
    - Make sure your IDE is set up to navigate and make code changes to the flask repository.
5. Familiarize yourself with flask. A great way is to read through the "A Minimal Application" and "Routing" sections of http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/. A deep understanding of Flask will not be necessary for completing this task, and you will be able to reference the documentation, so there is no need to memorize anything.
6. Save the pinned dependencies included at `requirements.txt` in this repository in a file `requirements.txt`.
